            But before anything here is some relaxing music for you:
        </p>
        <p>
            <audio controls>
                <source src="Zelda & Chill.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
            </audio>

            First maybe i should start talking about me: I'm Sabrina Masiero Schiochet, 21 years and currently i'm studying Videogames and Multimedia Applications. Wow!
        </p>
        <p>
            I came from a long way across the ocean: Rio Grande do Sul, Brasil, and i'm living in Portugal for 7 years now. Yeah it's a long time already. Looks like i really like it in here

            On my free time i enjoy gaming (obviously), going to the gym, reading and exploring the many forms of art (photography, painting, modeling, etc)
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm also enjoying programming but I really have to study for it frequently or else i lose the flow
        </p>
        <p>
            Also, this is my first time doing a website (again, obviously), and I'm looking forward to learn more :)
